User Stories
Cowboys and Aliens Simon

Simon is a game of speed where players must match the combination that the computer outputs. As the game progresses the intervals in which the player must select buttons decreases. One plays until he/she loses, for this is more of a 'high score' geared game. 

The computer starts by randmonly choosing an alien head, the user must follow this by clicking on the corresponding button. In round two, the computer will repeat the first selection, followed by a new random selection. The user must respond by clicking both corresponding buttons in the sequence. The game will continue until the user chooses a wrong button.
